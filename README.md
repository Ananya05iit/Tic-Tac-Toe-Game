# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game

I have designed the game of tic-tac-toe using the concepts of OOPs in JAVA. There are 2 versions of this game, one is a 2 - player game and other is a game against the computer. 
To play the game, run the TicTacToe.java file. It will ask for your choice of game type.
After that it will display the board with number for each block. Choose the number to make a move there.

After playing the game, the user is asked if he/she wants to continue or quit.

To make this game,  I used Object oriented programming of JAVA.
